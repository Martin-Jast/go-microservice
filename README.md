# go-microservice
Example of a Go microservice with API points, DB connection and modular architecture focused in using my test framework to test APIs


When testing try to use a docker that will put the mongoDB up so it has a clean database when it starts or remember to drop the database between tests ( to make sure no database is wrongly dropped the code don't do that )
